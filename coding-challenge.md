# Coding Challenge Requirements

If you don't already have code to share, you can work on our coding challenge described below.

Please organize, design and document your code as if it were going into production, then send us a link to the hosted repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab...).

## Technical spec

Your application should be split between a **back-end** and a **web front-end**.

We believe good engineering is about using the right tool for the right job, and constantly learning about them.

The **front-end** should ideally be a single page app with a single index.html linking to external JS/CSS/etc.

For the **back-end**, you can **use any web framework**, but here's some of the technologies our teams are familiar with:

- Python
- JavaScript
- Ruby
- PHP
- Go
- Java
- Elixir

## Functional spec

The coding challenge is about implementing an app that lists shops nearby.

- As a User, I can sign up using my email & password
- As a User, I can sign in using my email & password
- As a User, I can display the list of shops sorted by distance
- As a User, I can like a shop, so it can be added to my preferred shops
  - Acceptance criteria: liked shops shouldn’t be displayed on the main page

Bonus point (those items are optional):

- [BONUS] As a User, I can dislike a shop, so it won’t be displayed within “Nearby Shops” list during the next 2 hours
- [BONUS] As a User, I can display the list of preferred shops
- [BONUS] As a User, I can remove a shop from my preferred shops list

## How will we review?

Guidelines can be found in the original repo.
