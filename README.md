# Web Coding Challenge
The coding challenge is about implementing an app that lists shops nearby.

This README will also serve as a checklist during the developement process.

Technical spec
---------------
[x] Your application should be split between a **back-end** and a **web front-end**.

[?] The **front-end** should ideally be a single page app with a single index.html linking to external JS/CSS/etc. 
  - This criteria is respected exculuding the login and signup pages.

**back-end**: Django REST framework


Functional spec
---------------

[ ] As a User, I can sign up using my email & password
[ ] As a User, I can sign in using my email & password
[ ] As a User, I can display the list of shops sorted by distance
[ ] As a User, I can like a shop, so it can be added to my preferred shops

Bonus points (those items are optional):

[ ] As a User, I can dislike a shop, so it won’t be displayed within “Nearby Shops” list during the next 2 hours
[ ] As a User, I can display the list of preferred shops
[ ] As a User, I can remove a shop from my preferred shops list
